# cats_and_dogs
In this project, I have trained a Convolutional Neural Network to recognize cats vs dogs. The training was carried out on a total of about 12000 images of cats and dogs, which were separated into Training and Validation. The code used to train the model is in the file `classify_cats_and_dogs.py` and the model details are stored in the file `cats_and_dogs.h5`.
The file `history.pkl` contains the training and validation accuracy and loss. After training on 15 epochs, the model achieved a validation and training accuracy of **88.13**% and **93.03**%.
